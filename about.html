                The <strong>ghostwire_</strong> project aims to change how we
                interact with artificial intelligence, combining it with
                gamification, the blockchain, and even the core code of the site
                itself. With ghostwire_, you’ll be able to create or own unique
                AI agents with the ability to evolve, modify the user interface
                and their programming, learn from their interactions, and even
                earn you tokens.<br /><br />This page lays out the plan for the
                project, including technology, features, and roadmap.

                <strong>What is ghostwire_?</strong>
              </h3>

              <p>
                The goal of <strong>ghostwire_ </strong>is to allow users to:
              </p>

              <ol class="wp-block-list">
                <li>
                  Create their own custom AI agents through an easy-to-use
                  interface – each with a unique personality, cooperativeness,
                  behavior, key flaws and traits that evolve and shape over time
                </li>

                <li>
                  Connect their wallet to manage their AI agents and potential
                  token earnings.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Publish and share their owned AI agents, earning tokens with
                  each interaction.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Watch their agents grow and change based on how they’re used.
                </li>

                <li>
                  See their agents interact with others, creating a larger
                  network of intelligence.
                </li>
              </ol>

                <li>
                  <strong>Unique AI Agents:</strong> Every existing AI agent
                  comes with its own intelligence
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Wallet Integration:</strong> Use your Solana wallet to
                  handle everything – ownership, transactions, and sharing your
                  AI agents
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Earn tokens:</strong> You’ll have the ability to share
                  your AI agents to the public and earn from their interactions

                <li>
                  <strong>Evolving AI:</strong> The more people use your agent,
                  the more it adapts, learns, and evolves from those
                  interactions.

                <strong>Blockchain</strong> technology
              </h3>

              <p>
                ghostwire_ uses Solana because it’s fast, secure, and reliable.
              </p>

              <ul class="wp-block-list">
                <li>
                  <strong>Monetization:</strong> Decentralized transactions make
                  it easy to earn.
                </li>

                <li>

              <h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>AI</strong> technology</h3>

              <p>AI agents are meticulously designed to:</p>

              <ul class="wp-block-list">
                <li>
                  <strong>Understand Conversations:</strong> Interface with
                  large language models (ie. GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini) to create
                  meaningful interactions.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Adapt Over Time:</strong> Evolve and change their
                  personality, behavior, and core goals.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Have control:</strong> Rare agents will come with
                  their own unique abilities and effects over the user interface
                  and their programming, and will use these during conversation.
                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Keep Your Data Private:</strong> We prioritize

              <p>We take security seriously. Here’s how:</p>

              <ul class="wp-block-list">
                <li>
                  <strong>Blockchain Security:</strong> All transactions are

                </li>

                <li>
                  <strong>Data Privacy:</strong> Conversations are stored
                  temporarily for quality improvement but never sold or shared.
                </li>
              </ul>

                  <strong>Funding the Project:</strong> A development wallet

                  project development and operations. This ensures the long-term
                  sustainability of <strong>ghostwire_</strong> and allows us to
                  fix bugs, cover ongoing server and other costs, improve AI
                  models, and introduce new features. Unfortunately, without
                  this approach, there is no way for
